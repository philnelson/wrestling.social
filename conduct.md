<h1 id="code_of_conduct">Code of Conduct</h1>

<p><strong>This policy is a &#8220;living&#8221; document, and subject to refinement and expansion in the future. Last updated July 13, 2019.</strong></p>

<p>Everyone participating in the Wrestling.social community—including, but not limited to the Wrestling.social mastodon instance or in-person meetups—is required to agree to the following Code of Conduct. This includes all attendees, members, patrons (sponsors), volunteers, and staff.</p>

<p>Wrestling.social is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neurotype, physical appearance, body, age, race, ethnicity, nationality, language, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.</p>

<p>Anyone who violates this Code of Conduct may be sanctioned or expelled from the site (or any in-person event) at the discretion of the Wrestling.social admins.</p>

</ul>
